# DeveloperTools
This project represents tools that I find useful in my Career as a Developer, in the past I and others have used online tools to perform some of these tasks. Using online tools can compromise sensitive data being acted on. As such I needed a way to perform these actions without compromise of the data which the strings may contain. This project was created to perform these activities without sending the data over the network thus improving the security of the data being acted on.

More to come Soon....
